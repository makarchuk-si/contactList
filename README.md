# contactList

Contact List App provides:

1. [must have] Alphabetical sorted contact list with names at the center of each cell (borders of each cell are not shown)
2. [not described in TechTask] "Add contact" function (by pressing "+" button in the left bottom corner of the applicationwindow)
3. [nice to have] Circle contact list pictures
4. [nice to have] "Add to favourite" function (star button at the left side of each contact).
    
    Similar button above the plus button hides non-favourite contacts (this function needs improvement)
